# Compute the Similarity Between Two PDFs
This program takes in two PDF files (preferrably academic papers), converts them into file_1.txt and file_2.txt, then uses:

```
git diff --minimal --ignore-all-space --word-diff=porcelain --no-index --output file_diff.txt file_1.txt file_2.txt
```

to compare the words in each file. The similarity score percentage is computed with:

```
similarity = 1 - (words_added + words_removed) / (initial_word_count * 2)
```

## Usage
To use UI to select the PDF files with a verbose and pretty-printed output, including the word differences and the most occuring words, use:
```
python3 run.py
```
To automate computing the similarity and only output the similarity score (for usage by a machine) use:
```
python3 run.py file1.pdf file2.pdf
```

## Example output:

## Additionally
For researchers, consider using the contents from file_2.txt (the primary PDF) to further analyze the document.
