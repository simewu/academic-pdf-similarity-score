# Compute the Similarity Between PDFs
Services like [crossref](https://www.crossref.org/services/similarity-check/) offer a similarity tool to compare the contents of two manuscripts, returning a percentage of how similar one is to another. However, these tools are closed-source, and often require a membership. Free online tools may steal your manuscript, and can be inaccurate.

This open-source tool computes the similarity just like crossref, but is freely accessible to use by anyone. It takes in two PDF files (preferrably academic papers), and converts them into file_1.txt and file_2.txt, then uses:

```console
git diff --minimal --ignore-all-space --word-diff=porcelain --no-index --output file_diff.txt file_1.txt file_2.txt
```

to compare the words in each file. The similarity percentage does the same as crossref by computing:

```python
similarity = similar_words / initial_word_count
```

## Usage
To use UI to select the PDF files with a verbose and pretty-printed output, including the word differences and the most occuring words, use:
```console
python3 run.py
```
(Windows users can double-click run.bat).

To automate computing the similarity and only output the similarity score (for usage by a machine) use:
```console
python3 run.py file1.pdf file2.pdf
```

## Example output:
```
> python3 run.py example_paper_1_bitcoin.pdf example_paper_2_ethereum.pdf

0.1445993031358885

> python3 run.py

Select the baseline PDF file:
File 1  -  example_paper_1_bitcoin.pdf
File 2  -  example_paper_2_ethereum.pdf
Please select a file (1 to 2): 1

Select the primary PDF file:
File 1  -  example_paper_1_bitcoin.pdf
File 2  -  example_paper_2_ethereum.pdf
Please select a file (1 to 2): 2

[WORD DIFF]

Most used words in the primary paper: the, to, a, of, and, block, is, hash, [...]

Baseline file word count: 3444
Primary file word count: 13446
Added words: 12948
Removed words: 2946
Similar words: 498

max(similar/primary, similar/baseline)

```

## Additionally
For researchers, consider using the contents from file_2.txt (the primary PDF) to further analyze the document.
